<p>
The Earth Science collection supports students studying Earth science concepts as a part of a natural science
or physical geography course.  Activities are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards.
</p>
<p>
There are 15 pre-built maps [M] supporting Earth science classrooms - each with a short teacher guide [T] and student worksheet [S] to help 
you teach.

<ul>
<LI> Number of maps: 15
<LI> Number of activities: 20 (includes level 2)<br />
<LI> Target grade level: 7-10<br />

<LI>Select standards referenced in the collection:
<ul>
<LI>NGSS:MS-ESS2-4 – Develop a model to describe unobservable mechanisms.
<LI>NGSS:MS-ESS2-2 – Construct an explanation based on evidence for how geoscience pro- cesses have changed Earth’s surface ....
<LI>NGSS:MS-ESS2-3 – Analyze and interpret data on the distribution of fossils, rocks, continental shapes, & seafloor structures to provide evidence of past plate motions.
<LI>NGSS:MS-ESS3-1 – Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for how the uneven distributions of Earth’s mineral, energy, and groundwater resources are result of past and current geoscience processes.
<LI>NGSS:MS-ESS2-5 – Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and com- plex interactions of air masses results in changes in weather conditions.
<LI>NGSS:MS-ESS2-6 – Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating and rotation of the Earth cause patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that deter- mine regional climates.
